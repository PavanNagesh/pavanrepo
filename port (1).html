            <div class="question">4. The hierarchical data and how different tree data structures solve and optimize over the problem scenarios (tree, bst, avl, 2-3, red-black, heap, trie)</div>
            <div class="answer">
                <strong>Tree (General)</strong><br>
                Concept: A hierarchical structure with nodes connected by edges.<br>
                Advantages: Simple representation of parent-child relationships.<br>
                Problem Solved: General-purpose hierarchical data modeling, e.g., file systems, organizational charts.<br>
                Limitations: Lacks balance; inefficient for operations like search or insert in unstructured data.<br><br>
                <strong>Binary Search Tree (BST)</strong><br>
                Concept: A binary tree where the left child contains smaller values and the right child contains larger values than the parent.<br>
                Advantages: Enables efficient search, insertion, and deletion (O(h), where h is the height).<br>
                Problem Solved: Ordered data storage, dynamic set operations.<br>
                Limitations: Becomes skewed (degraded to linked list) if data is not evenly distributed, leading to O(n) time complexity for operations.<br><br>
                <strong>AVL Tree</strong><br>
                Concept: A self-balancing binary search tree where the height difference between subtrees is at most 1.<br>
                Advantages: Guaranteed O(log n) time complexity for search, insertion, and deletion.<br>
                Problem Solved: Overcomes imbalance issues in BSTs, ideal for applications requiring balanced datasets.<br>
                Limitations: Higher overhead for maintaining balance through rotations during insertion and deletion.<br><br>
                <strong>2-3 Tree</strong><br>
                Concept: A balanced search tree where nodes can have 2 or 3 children.<br>
                Advantages: Ensures balance, supports efficient search, insertion, and deletion in O(log n).<br>
                Problem Solved: Dynamically adjusting tree size for ordered data storage without skew.<br>
                Limitations: More complex to implement compared to BST or AVL tree.<br><br>
                <strong>Red-Black Tree</strong><br>
                Concept: A self-balancing BST where nodes have an additional color attribute (red or black) with rules to ensure balance.<br>
                Advantages: Balances the tree with fewer rotations than AVL trees; efficient for search, insert, and delete (O(log n)).<br>
                Problem Solved: Dynamic datasets in systems like databases, associative arrays, and memory allocators.<br>
                Limitations: More rotations than 2-3 trees in some cases; complex balancing rules.<br><br>
                <strong>Heap</strong><br>
                Concept: A binary tree-based structure satisfying the heap property:
                Max-Heap: Parent node is greater than or equal to its children.
                Min-Heap: Parent node is less than or equal to its children.<br>
                Advantages: Efficient O(log n) insertion and deletion of max/min elements.<br>
                Problem Solved: Priority queue implementations, scheduling problems.<br>
                Limitations: Inefficient for general search operations (O(n)).<br><br>
                <strong>Trie</strong><br>
                Concept: A tree used for storing strings where nodes represent prefixes.<br>
                Advantages: Fast search, insertion, and deletion (O(m), where m is the key length). Reduces storage for common prefixes.<br>
                Problem Solved: Word dictionaries, autocomplete systems, IP routing.<br>
                Limitations: Requires significant memory for sparse datasets.<br><br>

            <div class="question">8. Discuss the importance of graph algorithms with respect to spanning trees and shortest paths</div>
            <div class="answer">
                <strong>a) Spanning Trees</strong><br>
                A spanning tree is a subgraph of a graph that connects all the vertices with the minimum number of edges, ensuring no cycles. Algorithms like Kruskal's and Prim's focus on constructing minimum spanning trees (MSTs), which are particularly valuable in optimizing networks.<br><br>

                <strong>Importance of Spanning Trees</strong><br>
                Network Design: Spanning trees are critical in designing efficient network infrastructures like computer networks, telecommunications, and electrical grids. They minimize the total cost of connecting all nodes while ensuring redundancy is avoided.<br>
                Data Clustering: MSTs help in clustering data points by forming groups based on minimum connections.<br>
                Approximation Algorithms: Many approximation algorithms for complex problems, like the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), use MSTs as a foundation for finding near-optimal solutions.<br>
                Redundancy Analysis: By analyzing the edges excluded from an MST, engineers can identify potential redundancy or alternative paths in the network.<br><br>

                <strong>b) Shortest Paths</strong><br>
                Shortest path algorithms, like Dijkstra’s, Bellman-Ford, and Floyd-Warshall, determine the shortest route between nodes in a weighted graph. These algorithms have significant theoretical and practical importance.<br><br>

                <strong>Importance of Shortest Paths</strong><br>
                Navigation and Routing: These algorithms are fundamental in GPS and mapping systems to calculate optimal routes in road networks.<br>
                Transportation and Logistics: In supply chain management, shortest path algorithms optimize the movement of goods and reduce transportation costs.<br>
                Telecommunication: Routing protocols in computer networks, such as OSPF (Open Shortest Path First), use shortest path algorithms to establish efficient data transmission paths.<br>
                Game Development: In AI for games, shortest path algorithms are used to enable non-player characters to navigate game environments realistically.<br><br>

                <strong>Interconnection Between Spanning Trees and Shortest Paths</strong><br>
                Both spanning trees and shortest paths often rely on similar graph structures and properties, such as edge weights and connectivity.<br>
                Algorithms for MSTs, like Kruskal's, often contribute to preprocessing in shortest path problems to eliminate unnecessary connections or reduce the graph's complexity.<br>
                In real-world scenarios like urban planning, the combination of spanning tree methods and shortest path algorithms provides comprehensive solutions to optimize infrastructure while ensuring efficiency.<br>

            <div class="answer">
                <strong>a) Divide and Conquer</strong><br>
                This technique involves dividing a problem into smaller subproblems, solving them independently, and combining their solutions to address the original problem.<br>

                <strong>d) Backtracking</strong><br>
                Backtracking systematically explores all possible solutions by building them incrementally and abandoning solutions that fail to satisfy constraints.<br>
                <strong>Steps:</strong><br>
                Choose: Pick an option.<br>
                Explore: Recur to see if the option leads to a solution.<br>
                Unchoose: Backtrack if the choice does not work.<br>
